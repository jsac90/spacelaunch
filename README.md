This is a basic guess high low game based on some game on ZX Spectrum. 
Credit to this youtube video for the idea https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oo47qPvs3HQ
Tried to re-create this in python with my limited knowledge to try to brush off the rustiness

Basically you are stranded on a strange planet and you have to guess the boost needed to leave the planet
Gravity and Random values determine the boost needed
You have 10 turns to guess or aliens get you
